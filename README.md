# vas3k.blog

This repository contains the source code of my blog — https://vas3k.blog

It is completely custom and is not intended to be used as a universal blog engine. I keep his code here purely because why not. Open Source FTW!

⚠️ Use it at your own risk! I'm not responsible for any damages or your wasted time trying to get your blog up and running on this. Also, I don't provide any support for this code, sorry.


## ⚙️ Tech details

Backend:
- Python 3.11+
- Django 4+

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a package manager

Frontend:
- [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
- Mostly pure JS, no webpack, no builders
- No CSS framework

Blogging:
- Markdown with a bunch of [custom plugins](common/markdown/plugins)

CI/CD:
- Github Actions + SSH deployment using [docker-compose.production.yml](docker-compose.production.yml) as a service configuration


## 🏗️ How to build

If you like to build it from scratch:

```
$ pip3 install poetry
$ poetry install
$ poetry run manage.py migrate
$ poetry run manage.py runserver 8000
```

Don't forget to create an empty Postgres database called `vas3k_blog` or your migrations will fail.

Another option for those who prefer Docker:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 and see an empty page.
